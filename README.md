# Next.js getServerSideProps: Handling null or undefined data from API route

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where `getServerSideProps` encounters errors when the fetched data is null or undefined. The example uses NextAuth.js for authentication, but the core problem is relevant to any data fetching within `getServerSideProps`.

## Problem

The provided `MyComponent` fetches data from an API route. If the API route returns null or undefined, it causes an error.  This example shows how to gracefully handle such situations, preventing crashes and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Solution

The solution handles the null or undefined data and performs a redirect to a login page if no session exists or if the data is null or undefined.
